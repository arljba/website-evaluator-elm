### Intent
The intent of the project is to provide valuabel information about a website which couldnt be retrieved arbitrarely. Alot of enterprieses use sophisticated tools to monitor theyr website and get information like how many people are visiting what pages and how a user traverses the site. Obviously these are informations which cant be retrieved if not for being the owner of said website.This project rather focuses on gathering information which are available to the whole internet. In the following section the diffrent APIs that are being used for this purpose are being listed.
